## How to play
To play without a release version follow these steps:
1. Download to latest github code (make sure you have node and npm downloaded).
2. Open the commandline and set the directory to the folder where the game files exist.
2. Then run the command "npm install"
3. Then run the command "electron ."
4. The game window should open (hopefully with the game running properly).
